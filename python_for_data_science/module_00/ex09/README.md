# ft_package

This is a simple Python package that provides one function:
- `count_in_list(lst, item)` â€“ counts how often `item` appears in `lst`.

## Example

```python
from ft_package import count_in_list

print(count_in_list(["toto", "tata", "toto"], "toto"))  # Output: 2
print(count_in_list(["toto", "tata", "toto"], "tutu"))  # Output: 0
```
